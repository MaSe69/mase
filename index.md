# About 'Personality'

Personality has become a popular topic again, possibly because there are so many free personality tests available on the internet. <br>

I did a research on such tests available in English or German - and ended up with a clear favorite: HEXACO.
<br>
The HEXACO test describes your personality in a well-established scientific framework. Most importantly, the current version of the HEXACO tests provides you with the most useful result that I found so far.
<br>


## Personality Test - HEXACO

You can take the HEXACO test here:
- [HEXACO-PI-R test on hexaco.org](http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online/)

In about an hour you will have completed the 100+ questions. The site and the PDF with your results contains information about the 'dimensions' and 'facets' used in the test.

After having received your results, you might still want to have some additional information that supports to follow-up actions. 
As a data scientist, I analyzed anonymous HEXACO answers. This helped me to deepen my understanding of the facets which are crucial to such personality tests.

Particularly surprising were some of the averages which made me think: "Well, the others are quite different than I expected them to be." 


## Personality Test - HEXACO - In German

You might expect German-native speakers to take personality tests in German language. If you do so, you might find that the English words whose exact meaning you are not quite sure of are replaced by Latin words which give you the same trouble. For topics like 'extroversion', it does not help you to struggle with a German test result. 

I would recommend anybody to stick with the English HEXACO-version. The 100+ questions are sufficiently easy to understand and to answer.

For interpreting the results, I offer the following English-German translation pages:
- :de: [HEXACO Dimensions - German](HEXACO_DE)
- :de: [HEXACO Facets - German Lookup table](facetten_DE)
