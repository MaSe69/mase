# Data Science For Business

Back in 1993, I started with what is currently called "Data Science" in the context of applied Physics.
We found it amazing that material properties could be forecasted with [such accuracy](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199709/10)11:5<403::AID-CEM485>3.0.CO;2-L). <br/>
Data Science has only started to live up to its potential in the context of business. When you dig into it, what you get is smarter analysis for bigger profits. I have build on and within such systems on the full stack, from the databases to the user interfaces, moving millions of data. Read on to get fascinating details on [Data Science](datascience).

At first, however, it needs to be understood what leadership is all about.

# About me

I am passionate about getting the latest info on topics of my interest. I do not stop with consuming info but try to think it further. As a programmer, I know that services need to run at high quality, and that I only understood them when I managed to get them running. 
My topics of interest include the emergence of life, the prefrontal cortex, tribal rites, ... see [here](here) for findings.
