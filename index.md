# Data Science For Business

I have always been passionate about lists. "A day without a new list is a wasted day!", I said very long time ago. Back in 1993, I started with what is currently called "Data Science" in the context of applied Physics.
We found it amazing that material properties could be forecasted with [such accuracy](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199709/10)11:5<403::AID-CEM485>3.0.CO;2-L). <br/>

The fascination about data science is to get to insights about reality that often are unique. Only a few people or often only you have these data to deal with and find this or that particular relationship.<br/>

Data Science has only started to live up to its potential in the context of business. When you dig into it, what you get is smarter analysis for bigger profits. I have build on and within such systems on the full stack, from the databases to the user interfaces, moving millions of data. Read on to get fascinating details on [Data Science](datascience).


# Leadership Theory

Followers follow leaders. And leader - hopefully - follow insights gained by data science.<br/>

Insights are not really relevant unless somebody acts on them. Hence, insights must be packages such that leaders can do something with them.<br/>

This in turn leads to the question: What are leaders? What is leadership?<br/>

Decision-support systems are one tool bringing data science to the leadership. Wouldn't it be great to benefit from all the trial-and-error experience that other decision-makers gathered? 
At first, however, it needs to be understood what leadership is all about.

# About me

I am passionate about getting the latest info on topics of my interest. I do not stop with consuming info but try to think it further. As a programmer, I know that services need to run at high quality, and that I only understood them when I managed to get them running. 
My topics of interest include the emergence of life, the prefrontal cortex, tribal rites, ... see [here](here) for findings.
