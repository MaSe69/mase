# Data Science 

Data science essentially transforms a huge amount of data into observations that can be acted upon.

My prefered computer languages are currently Python and Julia. 

My focus topics on data science include

- Dataframes in Python (Pandas)
- Dataframes in Julia
- Comparison of dataframes in Python and Julia

I moved these topics to a dedicated website on [Data Science](https://mase69.github.io/dssb/).
Details are usually given in Juypter notebooks, which you can find from there.

All this deals with fundametal skills to build up knowledge on dedicated topics. The details however are sometimes hard to remember and it is good to have some kind of structure in this vast area. 

Let me mention my latest blog on a technical data science problem: [Compare two lists](comparetwolists)


# Consulting based on Data Science

# About me

You can find more on the page [About Me](aboutme)
As I am German, and the audience here is often expected to be more familiar with German than with English, some pages are in German, and marked with "DE".

If you wonder ... 
- There is no advertising on these pages.
