# On Personality


Free personality tests have become increasingly popular. Which one to take? How to interpret your results?

You should choose a good personality test, like HEXACO, because it describes your personality in a scientific framework.<br>
You can then compare your personal results with those of others. In turn, others can better assess your strengths.

May I recommend to do the HEXACO test on the respective page, get your result and background info here

- [Take the HEXACO-PI-R test on hexaco.org](http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online/)

In addition, you get here 
- Analysis by a data scientist on how others voted on the HEXACO facets.
- Thoughts on the results of the 'HEXACO 22.000+ answers sample'.
- Ideas on how to continue from such a description of personality.

Please continue reading here:

As some of the content is meant for a German audience, some pages are in German.

My slogan:

    Personality traits are double-edged swords, they can both help and hurt you.


# Other Social Topics Of My Interest

## On Teams

Having covered personality, is a good starting point to understand how successful teams should be staffed or transformed.

Composing flexibly new groups is a decisive human feature.
I looked in some depth how such groups are formed and how these groups are kept together.
Which is this social and how does it work?

## Leadership Theory

Teams typically come along with some kind of leadership, which might be very weak or extraordinarily strong.<br>
What does it take for an individual to become a leader?

## History

In the global, digital world, we are enabled to build big, strong teams to go for ambitious goals.<br>
When deciding about where we want to go to, we always should have an eye on where we came from.
The way history is told makes a key difference on our future ambitions.

The history topic is currently developed in German language:
- [Entscheidende Phasen der Geschichte](history_de) 

When ready, parts of it are planned to go here:
- [Decisive Phases in Human History](history) 

## Painting and Tattoo Design

Inspired by Bob Ross, I started with painting may years ago.
Later I switched to digital arts using the software Krita.
I then discovered that tattoos have played a significant role in both personality and team building.

#  Dataframes


Dataframes are key to mastering data science. 

Beautiful dataframes lead to deep and surprising insights. You can find my introduction to beautiful dataframes here:

- [beautifuldataframes.com](https://beautifuldataframes.com)


A much searched for topic is how to compare two lists. I once wrote up a working solution for both Excel and Python that is still up-to-date and has moved to here here:

- [Compare Two Lists](https://beautifuldataframes.com/comparetwolists )


My slogan:
 > 
    In a digital world, data science should be used as much as possible to increase the insights into any topic.
