# On Personality

You should be able to describe your personality in a stanardized framework, because this will make you more successful or happier in life, 

My favorite personality tests is the HEXACO test, which I describe in some detail.

As some of the content is meant for a German audience, some pages are in German and marked with "DE".

# On Teams

Reportedly, humans have two decisive features
- flexibility
- forming groups

The combination of these two features leads to some benefits, but comes also with some issues.
Being able to describe the own personality, you might move on to describe teams and the social glue that holds it together.
