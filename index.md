# Deep Dives In 'Personality'

Personality has become a popular topic again, possibly because there are so many free personality tests available on the 
internet. <br>

>
    "You should be aware of your personality to make the best out of it."


I did a research on such tests available in English or German - and ended up with a clear favorite: HEXACO.<br>

The HEXACO test describes your personality in a well-established scientific framework. 
Most importantly, the current version of the HEXACO tests provides you with the most useful result that I found so far.<br>


## Personality Test - HEXACO

In about an hour you will have completed the 100+ questions. The site and the PDF with your results contains information about the 'dimensions' and 'facets' used in the test.

After having received your results, you might still want to have some additional information that supports to follow-up actions. 
You can take the HEXACO test here - [HEXACO-PI-R test on hexaco.org](http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online/).


As a data scientist, I analyzed anonymous HEXACO answers. This helped me to deepen my understanding of the facets which are crucial to such personality tests. 
Particularly surprising were some of the averages which made me think: "Well, the others are quite different than I expected them to be." 
You can find some of my findings here [:us: Analysis of HEXACO answers](HEXACO) .


After having made use of personality tests like HEXACO, questions remain.
- Is there more to be known about personality?
- How can I use my knowledge about my personality for a happier life?
- Can I change my personality?


After having spent quite some time on this topic, see [References](references), here are my answers:

- HEXACO is just a starter to motivate deep dives into personality.
- Knowledge on personality in general and the specific own personality can increase happiness, success, ... .
- There are in fact tools to make personality changes in the long run.

Nach einer Einführung in den Persönlichkeitstest 'HEXACO' gibt es Erläuterungen zu dessen Dimensionen und Facetten. Die HEXACO-Facetten Seite fasst insbesondere Antworten so zusammen, dass ihre Bedeutung für die jeweiligen Extreme klarer wird.

# PAC-ISH-Model 

After having spent quite some time on personality and other topics of psychology, see [References](references), I found that it is worth experimenting with an own model.

Everybody might have an understanding of what 'personality' is, but it is difficult to find a precise definition. Once I started with such a definition, I quickly ended up with a model for the connection between body and behavior.


## PAC-ISH-Model - Components

In my world, it is common to break complex things down into components. Then, you describe these components and their interfaces. Some of these components are depicted below.

{% include images/image.html imagePath = "../assets/images/img_content/NPAC_Model.png" thisWidth ="400px"%}
PAC-Model: Personality, Attitudes and Capabilities as the fundamental components.<br>
</center><br>

On the southbound side, I would see anything that has to do with the body, the brain, the neurological framework - 'Neuro' in short. On the northbound side, I would see attitudes, goals and capabilities. I keep it short, because you might not be interested in the model, but what you get out of it. You can find here details on [the PAC Model](pac_model)


### Individual, Social, Hierarchical (ISH) - Structure

Each component has an internal structure 

- Individual
- Social 
- Hierarchical

Continue reading here on [the ISH Structure](ish_structure)


### Descriptions using the PAC-ISH-Model

Sorry to bother you with a model, but once you got one, you can address the more practical questions such as:

- How can you find out more about yourself?
- How can you describe or cluster other people?
- How can you compare yourself to others?
- How can you pick others, e.g. to form a successful team?

### Change using the PAC-ISH-Model

Let's assume that you want to change yourself. 
Which are tools for such change?

At least the following 'tools' came to my attention:
- Music
- Habits
- Body Language
- Symbols
