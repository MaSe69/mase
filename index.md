# On Personality

For me, the HEXACO test is sufficient for describing a personality in a scientific framework.<br>
You can do the HEXACO test on the respective page, get your result and background info there:

- [Take the HEXACO-PI-R test on hexaco.org](http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online/)

In addition, you get here 
- Analysis by a data scientist on how the others voted on the HEXACO facets.
- Thoughs on the results of the 'HEXACO 22.000+ answers sample'.
- Ideas on how to continue from such a description of personality.

Please continue reading here:
- [HEXACO on this site](HEXACO) 

As some of the content is meant for a German audience, some pages are in German.

# On Teams

Having covered personality, is a good starting point to understand how sucessful teams can be built.

Composing flexibly new groups is a decisive human feature.
I looked in some depth how such groups are formed and how these groups are kept together.
Which is this social and how does it work?

## History

In the global, digital world, we are enabled to build big, strong teams to go for ambitious goals.<br>
When deciding about where we want to go to, we always should have an eye on where we came from.
The way history is told makes a key difference on our future ambitions.

The history topic is currently developed in German language:
- [Entscheidende Phasen der Geschichte](history_de) 

When ready, parts of it are planned to go here:
- [Decisive Phases in Human History](history) 

## Painting and Tattoo Design

Inspired by Bob Ross, I started with painting may years ago.
Later I switched to digital arts using the software Krita.
I then discovered that tattoos have played a significant role in both personality and team building.

As the saying goes:

    There is as much science in a topic as there is maths.

In the digital world, this might lead to

    There is as much insight into a topic as there is data science.

Dataframes are key to mastering data science. 
Beautiful dataframes lead to deep and surprising insights.
