We are all aware of having a unique personality. <br>
You might want to be able to describe your personality in a stanardized framework, because this will make you more successful or happier in life or both.

My favorite personality tests is called HEXACO.

Would you like to find some surprising insights on how 'we really are'?

As some of the content is meant for a German audience, some pages are in German and marked with "DE". 

- [HEXACO (DE)](HEXACO_DE)

Inspired by Bob Ross, I started with painting may years ago.

As the saying goes:

    There is as much science in a topic as there is maths.
