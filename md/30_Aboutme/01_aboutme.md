# About Me

I was born in Freiburg, Germany. After a Diplom (kind of master) in Physics, I migrated to the digital world in the UK while doing a PhD at Warwick University. 

In 1996, I had my first web page online. Much of the rest is work of which I cannot disclose much here, but which influences the section of data science.
Hence, after 9 years in academia, I have collected 22+ years on professional experience.
