# Leadership Theory

Human attributes can vary between extremes, and it is similar with leadership.
Depending on the context, great leadership can be quite different. 
If you understand the context, however, the type of leadership required can be derived.
<br/>
There are many guides around trying to teach you how to become a better leader. Truth is that adults are too old to change most of the relevant features.
Only a small subset is possible to change. We deal with this subset at the end, but first, we need to lay the foundations to understand the context of leadership.

## Leadership Foundations

### Emotions

Leadership is certainly emotional. Leaders react differently and show particular emotions. If you had a boss, who "goes ballistic" on failures, you certainly know what I mean.
<br/>
Leaders often have a great intuition. This is the collection of experience they gathered - often subconsciously - from their first experience to lead others.

### Cognitive intererence

Great leaders often come with high intelligence. Emotions are very helpful for quick decisions, but sometimes emotions lead to conclusions that are plain wrong. 
Then, the so-called 'system 2' should set in and overrule.
<br/>
This is already the point where insights from data science come together with leadership. Great leaders correct their gut feeling when data analysis suggest a different likely outcome.

### Tribes

Leaders act within and define tribes. Leaders often decide on who is 'in' and who is 'out'. 
<br/>
Shame is one of the strongest human feelings, and leaders are skilled to make best use of it.
<br/>
Nobody would follow an inferior. Hence, leaders are masters on superiority. They know about hiearchies and status in their and many other tribes.

### Evolution

Leaders typically  love to look at themselves in a historic context. In fact, there is a lot leadership can pick up from evolution theory.

## Leadership Coaching

Everybody's capability to change is very much limited. 
<br/>
Fundamental are personality traits as described, e.g. by the HEXACO-model. In short, you should know where you stand in this model - and accept it as the starting point.
<br/>
From that starting point there is a lot to be done in the areas of body language, communication capabilities or cognitive skills.

### A Joke

A tourist walks into a sleepy mountain village. Arrogantly, he asks an elderly man. <br/>
"Was ever a 'big man' born here?" <br/>
The elderly contemplates the question for a long while. <br/>
"No," he admits. "Always small children." <br/>
