# Teams

## Team Personality Transformation

My underlying assumption here is that a team has a personality which can be described comparably to that of an individal.

Teams are formed to fulfill specific task, typically specified externally. For each task there is an ideal 'team personality' that fulfills this task best.

Team personality transformation means to change the current personality of the existing team to get closer to the ideal personality. 


### Personality of an Existing Team

HEXACO is presumably not sufficient to describe the personality of an existing team completely. However, HEXACO is a good start and as an established method it might be more acceptable than a green field approach.

The HEXACO scores of the team are simply the average values of its team members.

Simple example: If all team member are fearful, anxious and consider themselves as not particular creative, it might be unlikely that this team will come up with an innovation like a 'flying machine' or a new type of explosives.

### The Ideal Team Personality

For each cagegory of task, there is an ideal team personality. It is rather a cluster in the 6-dimensional HEXACO-space, i.e. some deviation from the ideal value is 'good enough'. 

Simple example: For a team in medical care, high empathy and perfectionism is desirable.

Apart from the external goal, as an important side condition, the team cohesion must be taken into account. <br> 
Simple example: Two individuals with high unconventionality and low modestity might trigger the team to split - or at least to be mainly consumed with team internal struggle instead of making progress towards the goal. 

### Optimizing Team Personality

The staffing of the team is obviously the first and possibly the most important step on team personality optimization.

Simple example: You have to staff a team of seven, with six individuals already named. The personality scores, e.g. the HEXACO scores, of each individual are known. Then, for picking the seventh team member out of a given set of applicants, you might want to choose the one that moves the team personality most towards the ideal team personality.

For a given team, there is still some potential to move the team personality.<br>
Personality traits are partially inherited, but also partially adopted according to experience.<br>
In particular, an individual might have deviated from his or her inherited personality in some facets. All that needs to be done is to move back to this original score. However, this 'moving back' is often not done and needs an external trigger.

## Background and Reasoning

### Dunbar's Numbers

In many publications and easy to find on the internet, e.g. in "How the Evolution of Social Life Shaped the Human Mind", see [References of this site](references) it was claimed that humans form groups of certain team sizes. In particular, the group size of 150 is important.

In this context, Dunbar's number mainly tell us where we are coming from. As social being, we need to be member of groups.

With respect to the HEXACO test, an interesting question might be which group the participant had in mind.
It is likely to make a difference, when investigating the propensity of cheating, if this cheating is understood to be with respect to the familiar group of 150 members or with respect to an rather anonymous state.

### System I and System II

One ingenuity of David Kahnemann has been to simplify the complexity of neurocience into just 'two systems'.

As Gamble, Gowlett and Dunbar, see [References of this site](references), indicate system II was rather developed to enable bigger group sizes. 

With system II comes along the human ability of imagination. 

With respect to the HEXACO test, the obvious question is which of the two systems gave the answer.
System II, which is aware of political correctness and repercussions?
System I, which is closer to the 'true self'?

### Flexible Groups

Humans are said to have two distinctive advantages, particularly over formerly competing animals:
- Working together in groups
- Being Flexible

A flexible group is a set of human individuals that is formed to reach an objective.

The outcome of a group can be vastly better than that of any individual. Therefore, companies try to build as many 'strong teams' as possible. 

Many teams however fail, both due to group internal reasons and to external changes. A well combined team can have a lot of inner strength to cope with unavoidable internal conflicts as well as gaining momentum to overcome biggest external hurdles. 
The happiness and fulfillment experienced by team members in such successful teams strengthen the implications by Dunbar's numbers, i.e. we humans are meant to florish in such groups.

### The Relevance of Imagination For Flexible Groups

Humans can form groups outside their family bonds.<br>
What ties such a group together? 

An image. An idea. A set of values or objectives.<br>
Outcomes of System II that can be communicated and understood.

With respect to the HEXACO test results, it is reassuring that most participants think of themselves to have a good imagination. Such a capacity to follow the imagination of others or to develop own imaginations, or both, is crucial for creating flexible groups. 

A great personality of a group optimized for a specific goal is a solid start, but without a  shared imagination even such a group is most likely going nowhere. For reaching goals, a vison is required that is presented in appealing images. This brings up the question of [Leadership Theory](leadership_theory)
