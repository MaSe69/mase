# Other Topics


## Leadership Theory

Teams typically come along with some kind of leadership, which might be very weak or extraordinarily strong.<br>
What does it take for an individual to become a leader?


- [Leadership Theory](leadership_theory)



## History

In the global, digital world, we are enabled to build big, strong teams to go for ambitious goals.<br>
When deciding about where we want to go to, we always should have an eye on where we came from.
The way history is told makes a key difference on our future ambitions.

The history topic is currently developed in German language:
- [Entscheidende Phasen der Geschichte](history_de) 

When ready, parts of it are planned to go here:
- [Decisive Phases in Human History](history) 

## Painting and Tattoo Design

Inspired by Bob Ross, I started with painting may years ago.
Later I switched to digital arts using the software Krita.
I then discovered that tattoos have played a significant role in both personality and team building.
