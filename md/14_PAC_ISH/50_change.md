# Change

If you want to change yourself, you might want to be more specific. 
- How can I change my neurological foundation?
- How can I change my personality?
- How can I change my attitudes?
- How can I change my goals?
- How can I change my capabilities?
- How can I change my trigger responses?

Whatever you change, it will require time and effort. Hence, the first question might be:
 - Why do you want to change anything?

Reasons for change include:
- Increasing you own happiness.
- Getting more appreciation.
- Climbing the hierarchical ladder.
