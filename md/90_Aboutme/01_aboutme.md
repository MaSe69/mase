# About Me

I was born in Freiburg, Germany. I got a Diplom (kind of master) in Physics. In 2000, I got a PhD at Warwick University, UK.

# Work experience

I have 20+ years of work experience, mostly is what is now called 'data science', e.g. an eternity ago I did the 'data science part' in a paper published during my studies:
- [Data Science in Applied Chemistry](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199709/10)11:5<403::AID-CEM485>3.0.CO;2-L). <br/>


## Data Science

I have always been passionate about lists. "A day without a new list is a wasted day!", I used to say. 
The fascination about data science is to get to insights about reality that often are unique. Only a few people or often only you have these data to deal with and find this or that particular relationship.


## Reading List

Here is a list on [Literature](references) on which some of the info here is based.
