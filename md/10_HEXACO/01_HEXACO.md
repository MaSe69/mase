# HEXACO

This site is not about personality tests. Personality tests however are a very good starting point. 

Many personality tests have been created. We screened many such tests and assessed the HEXACO test to be one of the best. HEXACO is possibly the most effective and efficient personality test.

Ideally, you can investigate HEXACO on your own. If you don't have that time, we feel the need to at least summarize what we think to be relevant in our context.


## Overview and References

Please feel encouraged to visit the official site and to perform the assessment for yourself and for others as described there.

- Kibeom Lee and Michael C. Ashton 

published a book which focuses on the H-factor that distinguishes HEXACO most from other personality tests

You can find many more references from there, which are more frequently updated than this would be possible here.


## The six dimensions

HEXACO describes personality using six dimensions.

- H - Honesty-Humility
- E - Emotionality
- X - eXtraversion
- A - Agreeableness
- C - Conscientiousness
- O - Openness to Experience

Admittedly, the X as the abbreviation for extraversion is a bit cheating, but the play of words to the figure of the hexagon is nice. It permits illustrations with each of the six dimensions being placed at a corner of the hexagon. 

For a non-psychologist and/or non-English native speaker, none of these dimensions might come naturally, i.e. would match a meaning already in common use. The true meaning of these dimensions can only be inferred from further explanations. 

Such an explanation is given by the sub-categories of the dimensions, which were called by the inventors 'facets'.
